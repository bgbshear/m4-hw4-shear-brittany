                <p>
                    In 2013, Noblezada was one of five finalists for the National High School Musical Awards. Her performance during the awards ceremony caught the attention of casting director Tara Rubin, who arranged an audition for 17-year-old Noblezada in front of director Cameron Mackintosh, who was casting for the forthcoming West End revival of "Miss Saigon." Noblezada was cast as Kim, the lead role, and left school to star in the production in London. Following the limited run of "Miss Saigon," Noblezada starred as Eponine in the 2016 West End production of "Les Mis√©rables." In 2018, she opened the lead role of Eurydice in "Hadestown" and performed in the show until her final performance on August 13, 2023.
